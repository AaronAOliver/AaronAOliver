## Hello, welcome to my profile!

I am currently progressing through a PhD at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in microbial genomics, after completing a bachelors in bioinformatics at UC San Diego.

My scientific interests are: 
- ➡️➡️➡️ Novel gene network structures for reference-free gene cluster identification
- 🧪 Prioritization algorithms for purifying microbiome-derived enzymes
- 🦠 Genome-resolved metagenomics to establish core microbial communities
- 🍴 Time series metatranscriptomics to study microbial digestion and detoxification
- 🌿 Algae-derived sustainable biofuels and bioproducts
